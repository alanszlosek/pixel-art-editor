# Pixel Art Editor

Just cuz.

If you'd like to watch me write the code for this project, check out my [Pixel Art Editor playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGonE3T1sorSsJwFLeuFBOc26oRJaMfA5) on YouTube. It might make good background noise. :-)

# Installation

Nothing to install. Just open index.html in your browser.

# Features

* Your creation is saved to your browser's localStorage every second as you edit
* 1px, 3px and 5px brushes
* Associate primary color with left mouse button, secondary with right
* Fill tool
* Zoom in/out - WIP
* Undo / redo
* Preview area for when you're working on tiling textures for something like [voxeling](https://github.com/alanszlosek/voxeling), which is my primary use case.
* Save to PNG via `HTMLCanvasElement.toDataURL()` ... browsers are awesome!

# Coming Soon

* Ability to edit more than 1 image at a time
